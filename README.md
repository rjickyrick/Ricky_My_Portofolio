# Ricky_Portofolio
A collection of selected data science projects to demonstrate skill sets, knowledge, and what I find interesting

## Contents
* __Artificial Intelligence__: NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) is being implemented on one of the pygame data to make an AI-driven project using Neural Network
* __Python OOP__: An object oriented programming example in Python 3 which will run simulations of diverse projects.
* __Python Web Scraping__: Simple web scraping example using Python's `beautifulsoup` and some initial processing, feature generation in R for international rugby scoring statistics.
* __Pygame__: Making a game using Python to invent an interactive game that is able to be enjoyed by both parties.
*__R__: Slight coding using R to make a web scrapper from a database on the web


## [Example Data Science Projects]
## In Progress
* __Movement of old projects into this repository__
  * Multiple Pygame Projects
  * Scraping Projects
* __New and ongoing projects__
  * More machine learning projects
    * Focus on deep learning architectures, reinforcement learning, time series applications
  * Other application + visualization tools
  * Learning Data Structures & Algorithms
  * Refresh Knowledge on Learning Acquired Coding Languages
  * Custom-written ML algorithms
    * Re-implementations to dive deeper into theory
    * Possible variants on existing algorithms
